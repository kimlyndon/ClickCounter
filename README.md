# Click-Counter

## UIKit Fundamentals Lessons 1-10 in iOS Developer Nanodegree Program
This app is the end product of learning object diagrams and hard coding buttons and labels to the User Interface. We created object properties and then diagrammed the target action. After setting the target action, the app was complete. Next, we had to experiment on our own:

### Take a few minutes to do some experimenting on your own.
[] Add an additional label and have it increment with the first This is where I added a second label setup under the first. I also changed the label name to an emoji. [] Add a decrement button I changed the button code to read "incrementButton" and added a "decrementButton" with the same featured code but with proper labelling. Here the action was split into two different target actions: one for increasing the number, and one for decreasing the number.[] Add an action that toggles the background color of the view with each click The original method was added to in order to reflect the two options of increasing or decreasing a number: the decreaseNum function. To both I added the means to change the background color when clicking the appropriate emoji.
This code has comments throughout to assist the user/coder/myself in understanding what each section of code represents.
